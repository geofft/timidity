.TH timidity.cfg 5 "February 03 2004" "2.13.0"
.SH NAME
timidity.cfg \- configure file of TiMidity++
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file \fBtimidity.cfg\fP describes the runtime environments of
timidity(1) that are the path of sound font, instruments
configurations or else.
.br
\fBTiMidity++\fP looks for the configuration file \fBtimidity.cfg\fP
at startup, before processing any options.  If it can't be accessed,
and the library path is changed with a \fB\-L\fP option on the command
line, then the default file will be sought again along the new library
path after processing all options, unless another configuration file
was specified with the \fB\-c\fP option.
.br
Configuration files define the mapping of MIDI programs to instrument
files.  Multiple files may be specified, and statements in later ones
will override earlier ones.
.SH SYNTAX
Following statements can be used in a configuration file:
.TP
.BI "dir " directory
Adds \fIdirectory\fP to the search path in the same manner as the
\fB\-L\fP command line option.
.br
Archive file are also allowed.
.sp
Example:
.br
dir /usr/local/share/timidity/inst/foo.zip#
.br
bank 0
.br
0 bar.pat
.br
1 baz.pat
.br
2 zoo.pat
.sp
At first, \fBdir\fP specifies the archive name (followed by `#') for
the path of patch files same as directory name (in this case,
/usr/local/share/timidity/inst/foo.zip).  \fBTiMidity++\fP recognize
the path is an archive file if the expression has the last character
`#', and also read the files contained in this archive file.  In
previous example the patch files bar.pat, baz.pat and zoo.pat
contained in the foo.zip are also installed.
.TP
.BI "source " file
Reads another configuration file, then continues processing the
current one.
.TP
.BI "bank " "[MapID1] number"
Selects the tone bank to modify.  Patch mappings that follow will
affect this tone bank.  You can indicate specific map as a target, by
specifing any ofthe following to \fIMapID1\fP: \fBgm2\fP, \fBsc55\fP,
\fBsc88\fP, \fBsc88pro\fP, \fBsc8850\fP, \fBxg\fP and \fBxgsfx64\fP.
.TP
.BI "progbase " number
Sets and displays the tone number from \fInumber\fP to
\fInumber\fP+128.  If \fBprogbase 1\fP are specified, tone numbers
that follow are set and displayed as the numbers from \fB1\fP to
\fB128\fP.
.TP
.BI "drumset " "[MapID2] number"
affect this drum set.  You can indicate specific map as a target, by
specifing any ofthe following to \fIMapID2\fP: \fBgm2drum\fP,
\fBsc55drum\fP, \fBsc88drum\fP, \fBsc88prodrum\fP, \fBsc8850drum\fP,
\fBxgdrum\fP and \fBxgsfx126\fP.
.TP
.BI "number " "file [options]"
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI "number %font " "file bank prog [key] [options]"
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI "number %sample " "file [options]"
Specifies that the MIDI program number in the current tone bank or
drum set should be played using the patch file.  If \fIfile\fP is
SoundFont, the specific instrument with \fIbank\fP, \fIprog\fP, and
\fIkey\fP is taken out by the format of \fBnumber %font\fP.  If
\fIfile\fP is linear AIFF or WAV sample data, the MIDI program number
is specified by the format of \fBnumber %sample\fP.  Options may be
any of the following:
.RS
.TP
.BI amp= amplification
Amplifies the instrument's volume by \fIamplification\fP percent.  If
no value is specified, one will be automatically determined whenever
the instrument is loaded.
.TP
.BI note= note
Specifies a fixed MIDI note to use when playing the instrument.  If
\fInote\fP is \fB0\fP, the instrument will be played at whatever note
the Note On event triggering it has.  For percussion instruments, if
no value is specified in the configuration file, the default in the
patch file will be used.
.TP
.BI pan= panning
Sets the instrument's default panning.  \fIpanning\fP may be
\fBleft\fP, \fBright\fP, \fBcenter\fP, or an integer between
\fB\-100\fP and \fB100\fP, designating full left and full right
respectively.  If no value is specified, the default in the patch file
will be used.  Note that panning controls in MIDI files will override
this value.
.TP
.BI tune= tuning[,...]
Adjust the instrument's root frequency.  \fBtune=1\fP causes \fB1\fP
half tone higher.  Since a fraction is available for \fItuning\fP, it
is possible to do fine tuning such as \fBtune=\-0.2\fP.  When two or
more sample data is contained, the arguments after the second can
specify different value respectively.
.TP
.BI rate= attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]
Set the instrument's ADSR rate.  Each value may be an integer between
\fB0\fP and \fB255\fP.  When you set only sustain rate,
.sp
6 GUS/hrpschrd.pat rate=::60
.sp
is available.  When you set only attack time fasten,
.sp
6 GUS/hrpschrd.pat rate=255
.sp
is available.  When two or more sample data is contained, the
arguments after the second can specify different value respectively.
.TP
.BI offset= attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]
Set the instrument's ADSR offset.  Each value may be an integer
between \fB0\fP and \fB255\fP.  The format is same as \fBrate=\fP.
.TP
.BI tremolo= sweep_increment:control_ratio:depth[,...]
Set the instrument's tremolo.  Each value may be an integer
between \fB0\fP and \fB255\fP.  The format is similar to \fBrate=\fP.
\fIsweep_increment\fP is the time until tremolo is started.
\fIcontrol_ratio\fP is the rate changing amplification.
\fIdepth\fP is the depth changing amplification.
.TP
.BI vibrato= sweep_increment:phase_increment:depth[,...]
Set the instrument's vibrato.  Each value may be an integer
between \fB0\fP and \fB255\fP.  The format is similar to \fBrate=\fP.
\fIsweep_increment\fP is the time until vibrato is started.
\fIphase_increment\fP is the rate changing frequency.
\fIdepth\fP is the depth changing frequency.
.TP
.BI sclnote= note[,...]
Set the instrument's standard note for scale tuning.  For example,
\fBsclnote=60\fP causes the center note C to be standard note for
scale tuning.  When two or more sample data is contained, the
arguments after the second can specify different value respectively.
.TP
.BI scltune= tune[,...]
Set the instrument's scale tuning factor in cents.  For example,
\fBscltune=50\fP causes the half tone steps as \fB50\fP cents.  When
two or more sample data is contained, the arguments after the second
can specify different value respectively.
.TP
.BI modrate= attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI modoffset= attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]
Set the instrument's behavior of change of modulation envelope.
The format and values are fundamentally same as volume envelope.
Except for some SoundFonts, even if it specifies only the option,
nothing happens.
.TP
.BI trempitch= num[,...]
Set the instrument's depth of changing pitch according to tremolo.
The effect itself is same as vibrato, it uses to operate in another
system.  The unit is +\-cent.  The format is similar to \fBrate=\fP.
.TP
.BI tremfc= num[,...]
Set the instrument's depth of changing cutoff frequency according to
tremolo.  It can express the so\-called glowl effect.  The unit, etc.
are same as \fBtrempitch=\fP.
.TP
.BI modpitch= num[,...]
Set the instrument's depth of changing pitch according to modulation
envelope.  It can temporarily express raising pitch only for the
attack stage.  The unit, etc. are same as \fBtrempitch=\fP.
.TP
.BI modfc= num[,...]
Set the instrument's depth of changing cutoff frequency according to
modulation envelope.  The unit, etc. are same as \fBtrempitch=\fP.
.TP
.BI fc= num[,...]
Set the instrument's standard of cutoff frequency.  The unit is Hz.
The format is similar to \fBrate=\fP.
.TP
.BI q= num[,...]
Set the instrument's Q (resonance).  The unit is cB.  The format is
similar to \fBrate=\fP.
.TP
.BI fckeyf= num
Set the instrument's filter key follow.  Based on \fBnote=60\fP, it
change cutoff frequency according to note.  The unit is +\-cent/key.
 For example, \fBfckeyf=100\fP means that it change same as pitch.
.TP
.BI fcvelf= num
Set the instrument's filter velocity follow.  Based on
\fBvelocity=127\fP, it change cutoff frequency according to velocity.
The unit is +\-cent.  In SoundFont, \fB\-2400\fP is set up as a
characteristic value.
.TP
.BI qvelf= num
Set the instrument's resonance velocity follow.  Based on
\fBvelocity=0\fP, it change resonance according to velocity.  The unit
is +\-cB.
.TP
.B keep={loop|env}
By default, percussion instruments have their loop and envelope
information stripped.  Strangely shaped envelopes are removed
automatically from melodic instruments as well.  \fBkeep=\fP can be
used to prevent stripping loop or envelope data.  For example, the
Short and Long Whistle percussion instruments (General Midi numbers 71
and 72) need to have `\fBkeep=loop keep=env\fP' specified in the
configuration file.
.TP
.B strip={loop|env|tail}
Force removal of loop or envelope information from all patches in the
instrument, or strip the tail, i.e. all data after the loop.  Some
third\-party instruments have garbage after the loop, as evidenced by
a clicking noise whenever the instrument is played, so adding the
\fBstrip=tail\fP option will markedly improve sound quality.
.TP
.BI comm= comment
Specifies the comment \fIcomment\fP.
.RE
.TP

\fB0\fP.
.TP
.BI "#extension rnddelay " "progno msec"
For every pronunciation, it is random and less than a maximum of
\fImsec\fP delay.  The distribution of random value is pink noise
(1/f fluctuation) rather than a white noise.
.LP
These \fB#extension\fP statements are beginning with character `#'
that is the comment flag of old TiMidity (version 0.2i or earlier).
So these statements are treated as comment line.
.br
The latest \fBTiMidity++\fP treats \fB#extension\fP as white\-space.
So you can omit it.
.LP
If any file\-name expression ended with character `|' (Ascii 0x7c),
the file\-name is treated as command and outputs of the command
are also examined as arguments of statements.
.br
\fBsource\fP \fIcommand\fP| causes the output of \fIcommand\fP becomes
the argument of \fBsource\fP.  It is convenient to choose settings of
\fBTiMidity++\fP according to environment.  In addition, if a space
enters on the way like \fIcommand\fP |, it will be divided at the time
of setting file reading, and will no longer be regarded as a command.
This function is applicable to all the places that can specify a file
name.
.sp
