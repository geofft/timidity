timidity (2.13.2-7.3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * High-urgency upload for RC bugfix.
  * Call start-stop-daemon with --oknodo when stopping timidity in the
    init script, so that a stopped daemon isn't treated as an error on
    upgrade.  Closes: #414929.
  * Also, don't use --exec with start-stop-daemon --stop, as this will
    fail to find a running daemon if the on-disk binary has been moved
    out from under us for any reason; use --name instead.

timidity (2.13.2-7.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload with maintainer permission.
  * Don't enable alsa on non-linux architectures.
  * Don't build-depend on libasound2-dev on kfreebsd-i386,
  * kfreebsd-amd64 and hurd-i386 (closes: #327689)

timidity (2.13.2-7.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * High-urgency upload for RC bugfix.
  * Build-depend on libx11-dev, libxext-dev, libxmu-dev, libxpm-dev,
    libxt-dev, x-dev instead of on the obsolete xlibs-dev (closes: #346962).
  * Build-depend on libxaw7-dev instead of libxaw8-dev -- according to the
    XSF, libxaw8-dev is expected to be dropped in Xorg 7.0.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Jan 2006 23:06:19 -0800

timidity (2.13.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update libjack-dev dependencies (closes: #317227)
  * Update libflac-dev dependencies (closes: #325947)
  * Fix support for seekable FLAC streams by using the correct API
    (flac_a.c) for metadata, which does NOT have callbacks on seekable
    streams.  Not that it matters much, as apparently TiMidity++ never
    tries to produce seekable FLAC streams currently
  * Build against libslang2-dev (closes: #315238)
  * Build against new libxaw8-dev, instead of libxaw7-dev
  * Execute libarts1 transition by rebuilding, no changes
  * Remove redeclaration of voices in interface/xaw_i.c:264, patch from
    Ubuntu (closes: #324400)
  * Bump standards version to 3.6.2 (no changes)
  * This upload addresses all bugs in the intended 6.1 NMU by
    Loïc Minier <lool@dooz.org>, even if it fixes them diferently.
    Therefore, it closes: #326454
  * s/antialias/anti-alias/ in timidity.cfg (closes: #310307)
  * Fix spelling errors in some manpages, thanks to A Costa
    (closes: #300337, #309888)
  * Remove references to some old cruft utilities from manpage
    (closes: #292415)
  * Add a midrange sample config option set (closes: #305918)

timidity (2.13.2-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Rebuild against libflac 1.1.1-5.  This does NOT fix the whole
    fucked-up soname issue, since oggflac's still broken.  But it will
    make the package installable for the time being (closes: #289251)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Jan 2005 17:08:57 -0200

timidity (2.13.2-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * The arts_free() fixes are now considered stable (although aRts
    support is still much worse than ALSA support, and it has some ugly
    open bugs), so set urgency=high on this upload
  * Fix gcc 3.4 FTBFS problem, thanks to Andreas Jochens <aj@andaco.de>
    for the patch (closes: #280267)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Nov 2004 11:54:26 -0200

timidity (2.13.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * aRts arts_free() fixes, chapter II: do not call arts_free() at all
    during normal program operation.  Install atexit() handler to
    call arts_free() on clean exits.  Thanks to Georg Wittenburg
    <georg.wittenburg@gmx.net> for feedback on how 2.13.2-3 worked out.

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Nov 2004 21:15:23 -0200

timidity (2.13.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * It seems that doing some QA work and submiting a patch to the upstream
    BTS can really wake them up :)
  * upstream CVS: Fix NULL pointer derreference on empty sample names
  * Minor updates to package descriptions in the control file
  * Add primary watch file entry based on prdownloads.sf.net, since the
    ftp servers for sf.net are not realiable at all
  * Drop all aRts functionality that requires arts_free().  See Debian
    bug #247793, TiMidity++ bug #25, KDE bug #84514.  aRts users, you better
    give me some feedback about how well 2.13.2-3 works with aRts, otherwise 
    I will seriously consider killing aRts support altogether for the next
    stable release (closes: #239982)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Oct 2004 11:21:18 -0300

timidity (2.13.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream source:
    * timidity.c: one s/strcat/strncat/.
  * Quote properly all M4 stuff in autoconf/
  * This should get us in sync with upstream, in a very safe way :P
  * Urgency high because there are only obvious trivial changes

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Oct 2004 19:23:28 -0300

timidity (2.13.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

timidity (2.13.0.final-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update build-deps a bit:
    + remove libgtk1.2-dev, since we disabled the GTK frontend because
      of glib1.2/glib2.0 clashes caused by libarts1, and the stupid idea
      of not using symbol versioning in these libs on the first place
    + rename nas-dev to libaudio-dev
  * Fix bashism on initscript (really closes: #267300)
  * Add watch file for uscan/DEHS

  * Make sure to use Alsa sound output by default when using the initscript
    (closes: #242287)
